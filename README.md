### Project description:
We found the following challenge on [![challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/the-2016-fda-naloxone-app-competition/)], the hub for listing challenge and prize competitions, all of which are run by more than 100 agencies across federal government. These problem-solving events include idea, creative, technical and scientific competitions in which U.S. federal agencies invite the publicâ€™s help to solve perplexing mission-centric problems.

#### Our challenge description:
Design an App that helps solve the problem we face when getting Naloxone to the people who need it, people who need the antidote to reverse a drug overdose.

So we created this mobile first web application to help with that problem.

#### Tools we used:
 Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, oAuth, Twilio API, Google maps API.
