### Project description
Using node.js, HTTP, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose we have created a Server that responds to different GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE responses from a developer, backend position. The requests to our live server can interact with a remote Database created through Mlabs. In this example we use two schemas- Users and APIs. There are two types of Users, SuperUser and User. Only the SuperUser can POST, PUT, and DELETE. This project represents what is possible with a few simple tools.
